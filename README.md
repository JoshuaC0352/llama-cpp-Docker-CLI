# llama-cpp-Docker-CLI
A docker file setup that contains a command line interface that can interface with a desired .gguf LLM

Pull the repository, then use a docker build command to build the docker image.  When you run the image use docker run -it [image_name].  It has to be run in interactive mode, since it uses a command line interface.
